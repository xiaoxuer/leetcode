solution 1 count 
solution 2 swap 

// one pass in place solution

void sortColors(int A[], int n) {
    int j = 0, k = n - 1;
    for (int i = 0; i <= k; ++i){
        if (A[i] == 0 && i != j)
            swap(A[i--], A[j++]);
        else if (A[i] == 2 && i != k)
            swap(A[i--], A[k--]);
    }
}

key here is to update r & b when i > r && i < b 
and also since the element swapped in may needs to be processed 
ensure after update next iteration of for loop needs to evaluate i as well
